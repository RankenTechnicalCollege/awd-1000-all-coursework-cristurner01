                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>give the element a position of sticky and a property that tells the element when to become stuck (top, bottom, left, right).</p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>give the element a relative position and either top, bottom, left, right, the shift the element somewhere on the viewport</p>

                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>give the element a position property with a value of fixed. Add a property of either top, bottom, left, or right, to put the element in the position it will be fixed in.</p>

            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>give an element a position of absolute, and then specify either top, bottom, left or right to determine its position relative to the viewport.</p>

    <p>Guideline 1.1 - Text Alternatives: Non-text content(visual, auditory) has a text alternative, to make information accessible to users who can't see an image or hear an audio file.</p>
    
    
    <p>Guideline 1.2 - Time-based Media: For Prerecorded Audio-only and video-only, the alternatives are captions(prerecorded and live), audio description for synchronized media, sign language interpretation for prerecorded audio, extended audio description, media alternative for all prerecorded synchronized and video-only media, and text for audio-only live content.</p>
    
    
    <p>Guideline 1.3 - Adaptable: The content cen be presented in different ways without loosing information or structure. INFO and RELATIONSHIPS: ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. MEANINGFUL SEQUENCE: When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, you can provide an alternative presentation of content while preserving the reading order. SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS: Describe controls by name, and not just appearance or location. ORIENTATION: Don't lock content to either portrait or landscape presentation, so devices can be used in any orientation. IDENTIFY INPUT PURPOSE: indicate the purpose of common inputs so its easier to fill out forms. IDENTIFY PURPOSE: Indicate the meaning of all controls and other key information, so its easier to navigate and operate content.</p>
    
    
    <p>Guideline 1.4 - Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content. Use information in addition to color, such as shape or text. If you play audio content automatically, let people turn it down or off. Provide sufficient contrast between text and its background. Ensure text(except captions) can be resized. Use text instead of pictures of text. Strongly contrast text against its background(unless its a logo, incidental text, or large-scale text). Allow for text format readjustment. Do not use pictures of text unless there is no other way to present information(like a logo). Content can be enlarged without increasing line length, so scrolling in 2 dimensions isn't required. Ensure the visual representation of user interface components and graphical objects have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color. Ensure content adapts to user-defined text settings(like line height). If hover or focus triggers content changes, ensure interaction is predictable.</p>

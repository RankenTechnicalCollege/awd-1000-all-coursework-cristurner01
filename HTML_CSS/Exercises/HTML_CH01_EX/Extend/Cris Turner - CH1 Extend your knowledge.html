    <p>Guideline 1.2 - Time-based Media: For Prerecorded Audio-only and video-only, the alternatives are captions(prerecorded and live), audio description for synchronized media, sign language interpretation for prerecorded audio, extended audio description, media alternative for all prerecorded synchronized and video-only media, and text for audio-only live content.</p>
    
    
    <p>Guideline 1.3 - Adaptable: The content cen be presented in different ways without loosing information or structure. Info and relationships: ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes.

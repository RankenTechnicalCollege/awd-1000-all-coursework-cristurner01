  <h3>Chapter 1, Apply your Knowledge</h3>

  <p>I am using Visual Studio Code to complete this assignment</p>

  <P>To plan a website, before coding you need to know its purpose, know who its for and account for multi-platform display, and design a wireframe and site map. You also need to know what graphics you want to use, navigation elements, color scheme, and consider accessability. </p>

  <p>In chapter 1 I learned how to use HTML to make a basic web page. I also learned the role of other web programming languages in addition to HTML, to add interactivity to a website.</p>
